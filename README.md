A Website for my Food Chemistry Platform, Yumistry!

This is one of the first projects I've worked on related to web design.
While the code lacks a lot of the techniques and intricacies of a modern
web platform, it is still a project I am proud of since it reminds me of
how far I've come in my programming career. This project fueled my curiosity
of coding, and has played an instrumental role in driving me to where
I am today. A link to the website can be found here:
