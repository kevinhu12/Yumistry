        <p>Hi everyone, we’re so glad to be back! As the days get shorter, 
          many of us have inevitably turned to humanity’s psychostimulant of 
          choice to get us through the day. How does it work though? Most of us 
          know that the active component of coffee is caffeine. This molecule 
          may be small, but it sure is powerful! Caffeine takes its effect at 
          neurons. On neurons' cell membranes, there's a place where adenosine 
          can bind. Adenosine makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine binds to the exact 
          same receptor, which means that caffeine blocks adenosine. This is 
          possible because caffeine's structure is similar to the part of adenosine 
          that binds to its receptor. Structural similarity allows caffeine to 
          fit into a protein receptor whose shape complements adenosine. However, 
          when caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, it doesn't have the same 
          "braking" effect. Thus, neural activity increases, which is why you 
          feel more awake after drinking coffee. Caffeine acts on multiple 
          neural pathways. This triggers the pituitary gland to release a 
          hormone that makes the adrenal gland release adrenaline. This "fight 
          or flight" hormone gives us even more energy. In liver cells, 
          caffeine is initially digested in a part of the cells called 
          "endoplasmic reticulum." The main product formed when caffeine 
          interacts with the enzyme CYP1A2 is paraxanthine, which is about 
          as effective as caffeine, and has the added effect of increasing 
          the rate of fat digestion. Other products from caffeine breakdown 
          are theophylline, theobromine, and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. 
          Theophylline dilates the bronchi, which allows for greater 
          inhalation. Theobromine doesn't stimulate neurons in the way 
          caffeine does, but it boosts mood. 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid is the 
          odd one out; it can actually be directly excreted through urine and 
          is essentially a waste product. Whether you’re a latte, 
          americano, or instant coffee person, you can thank caffeine for 
          helping you through the everyday hustle and bustle!
