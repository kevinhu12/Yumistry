        <p>Evening folks! Welcome back :) We hope you have all been keeping 
          safe during these trying times…
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, we bring to you… purple lemonade! No, not the cannabis 
          strain. We’re talking about the drink! This mysterious concoction 
          starts out a vibrant royal blue, and then turns into a magenta 
          colour once you add lemonade.
        </p>

        <p>The recipe is simple. You start by making tea out of butterfly 
          pea flowers. Once that’s done, you pour in lemonade. Finally, you 
          stir to mix the two solutions as well as to mix the two colours.
        </p>

        <p>This phenomenon is all about pH. If you’ve ever played with 
          litmus paper in science class, you’ve already seen an example of 
          colour change as a result of pH change. The compounds that are 
          capable of this colour change are called indicators
        </p>

        <p>Butterfly pea flowers have an indicator called delphinidin 
          (C15H11O7). Delphinidin is a type of anthocyanidin (not to be 
          confused with anthocyanins!), a class of compounds that give 
          blueberries, raspberries, pansies, acai, blackcurrants, cherries 
          and eggplants their colours. Different anthocyanidins share the 
          same conjugated carbon ring structure, but different functional 
          groups at seven locations at 7 points on that structure. 
          Delphinidin just happens to have just the right combination of 
          functional groups to allow the molecule to reflect a blue-violet 
          wavelength at your starting pH.
        </p>

        <p>As you add lemonade, you’re introducing more hydrogen ions. Why? 
          Lemons contain a lot of citric acid, which has a hydrogen that can 
          dissociate from the rest of the molecule easily. When you introduce 
          acid into butterfly tea, the delphinidin gets protonated to remove 
          some of the hydrogen ions in the solution. Protonated delphinidin 
          has magenta colour. As you introduce more and more acid, more and 
          more delphinidin become protonated. Hence, you see the magenta 
          colour seemingly erase the blue colour.
        </p>

        <p>This simple drink is awesome because you can make it to impress 
          your friends, to bring some spooky vibes to a pool party, or to 
          impress your chemistry teacher with your understanding of pH 
          indicators and equilibrium! One note though: make sure you add 
          sugar!

        <p>Hi everyone, we’re so glad to be back! As the days get shorter, 
          many of us have inevitably turned to humanity’s psychostimulant of 
          choice to get us through the day. How does it work though?
        </p> 
        
        <p>Most of us know that the active component of coffee is caffeine. This molecule 
          may be small, but it sure is powerful! Caffeine takes its effect at 
          neurons. On neurons' cell membranes, there's a place where adenosine 
          can bind. Adenosine makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine binds to the exact 
          same receptor, which means that caffeine blocks adenosine. This is 
          possible because caffeine's structure is similar to the part of adenosine 
          that binds to its receptor. Structural similarity allows caffeine to 
          fit into a protein receptor whose shape complements adenosine. However, 
          when caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, it doesn't have the same 
          "braking" effect. Thus, neural activity increases, which is why you 
          feel more awake after drinking coffee. Caffeine acts on multiple 
          neural pathways. This triggers the pituitary gland to release a 
          hormone that makes the adrenal gland release adrenaline. This "fight 
          or flight" hormone gives us even more energy.
        </p>
        
        <p>In liver cells, caffeine is initially digested in a part of the cells called 
          "endoplasmic reticulum." The main product formed when caffeine 
          interacts with the enzyme CYP1A2 is paraxanthine, which is about 
          as effective as caffeine, and has the added effect of increasing 
          the rate of fat digestion. Other products from caffeine breakdown 
          are theophylline, theobromine, and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. 
          Theophylline dilates the bronchi, which allows for greater 
          inhalation. Theobromine doesn't stimulate neurons in the way 
          caffeine does, but it boosts mood. 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid is the 
          odd one out; it can actually be directly excreted through urine and 
          is essentially a waste product. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Whether you’re a latte, americano, or instant coffee person, you can thank caffeine for 
          helping you through the everyday hustle and bustle!
        </p>
